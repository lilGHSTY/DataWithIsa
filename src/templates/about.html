            <h2>Hi, I'm Isa</h2>
            <p>I help small businesses make sense of their data without the complexity of enterprise tools or the cost of hiring a data team.</p>
            <p>With a background in data analysis and a passion for helping businesses grow, I created DataWithIsa to bridge the gap between raw data and actionable insights.</p>
            
            <h3>Why I Started DataWithIsa</h3>
            <p>I noticed that most business intelligence tools are either too complex for small businesses or too expensive. You shouldn't need a PhD in data science to understand your business metrics.</p>
            <p>That's why I offer done-for-you dashboards. I handle the technical complexity, you get the insights.</p>
            
            <h3>My Approach</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Personal consultation to understand your unique needs</li>
                <li>Custom dashboard design focused on your key metrics</li>
                <li>Clear, actionable insights without the jargon</li>
                <li>Ongoing support to help you make data-driven decisions</li>
            </ul>
