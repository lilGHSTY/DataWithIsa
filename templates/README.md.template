# Documentation Templates

This directory contains template files that Claude Code uses during the setup phase to create project-specific documentation.

## Template Files

- `REQUIREMENTS.md` - Project requirements and user stories
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - System architecture and technical design
- `API_REFERENCE.md` - API endpoints and documentation
- `PROGRESS.md` - Development progress tracking
- `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` - Testing approach and guidelines

## How It Works

1. During setup phase (`/setup start`), Claude Code reads these templates
2. Claude Code asks discovery questions about your project
3. Claude Code copies templates to `docs/` and fills them with project-specific content
4. Templates remain unchanged for future projects

## Adding New Templates

Create new .md files here following this pattern:
- Use placeholder text: `[Description of what goes here]`
- Include empty sections that need filling
- Add helpful comments for Claude Code
