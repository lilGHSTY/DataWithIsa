## ðŸš€ User Workflow Changes

### Before Enhancements
1. Run basic bootstrap script
2. Manual virtual environment setup
3. Frequent environment conflicts
4. Generic template documentation
5. Manual git operations
6. Playwright MCP often failed on Linux

### After Enhancements
1. Run Docker-first bootstrap script
2. **Automatic** container environment setup
3. **Zero** environment conflicts (Docker isolation)
4. **Professional** template-guided documentation
5. **Automatic** git commits and GitHub integration
6. **Reliable** Playwright MCP on all Linux systems

## ðŸ“Š Success Metrics
