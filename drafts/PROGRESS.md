## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Aug 12 Timeline**: Aggressive but achievable with landing page focus
  - *Mitigation*: Prioritize client-facing features, defer admin polish
- **Jina.ai Integration**: New service, potential learning curve
  - *Mitigation*: Start with simple queries, use free tier for testing
- **Design Quality**: Need professional look for funding/clients
  - *Mitigation*: Focus on clean, minimal design; 3D placeholders for MVP

### Business Risks
- **First Client Acquisition**: 15 days is tight
  - *Mitigation*: Start with warm leads, leverage existing network
- **Service Delivery**: Need to fulfill 24-48 hour promise
  - *Mitigation*: Create templates, practice workflows
