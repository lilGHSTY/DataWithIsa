# Project Documentation

This directory will be populated during the setup phase with project-specific documentation.

## Files Created During Setup

Claude Code will create these files based on templates:

- `REQUIREMENTS.md` - What we're building and why
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - How the system works technically  
- `API_REFERENCE.md` - API endpoints and usage
- `PROGRESS.md` - Development milestones and tracking
- `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` - How we ensure quality

## Process

1. Run `/setup start` to begin setup phase
2. Claude Code reads templates from `templates/` directory
3. Claude Code asks questions about your project
4. Claude Code creates customized docs in this directory

The templates remain unchanged so you can use this skeleton for future projects.
